# AI-Hacks

## Inspiration
Having learned a lot of matlab these past few months, I wanted to create a matlab game which incorporated AI into it and user interaction to create a fun approach to hangman.

## What it does
The game has a start screen on which the AI is there and you can press the play button to take you to the game. After that, you have a few tries to guess the word after which if you use up all your tries and can't get the word, the entire hangman figure is drawn and the game ends.

## How we built it
I built this game using MATLAB and the app designer app in matlab.

## Challenges we ran into
Originally, I was having trouble getting the buttons to work in the appdesigner, but was then able to figure out what to code inside of it to get it to work. I also wasn't initially able to get the dashes to appear so the user knows how many letters was in that word but was eventually able to fix it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was able to make an entire MATLAB game in one weekend and completely learn how to use app designer to make the complete app. I am also now as familiar with making apps as I am for websites so this helped me realize that I am fully capable of making complete apps in future Hackathons.

## What we learned
I learned how to use appdesiner to make complete apps in MATLAB and use AI in MATLAB.

## What's next for AI Hangman
- Create more features in Hangman.
- More AI Graphics.
- Updates.
